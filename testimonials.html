First, Latoya Smith was very highly recommended by my moving company and now I know why! By the time I met Latoya I had interviewed three of the very top Realtors®️ in Sonoma county and was about to make a decision until we interviewed Latoya. She blew the others out of the water! From that point forward upon hiring Latoya she took charge and professionally steered me through some major obstacles. Secondly, and just as importantly, on a personal level, Latoya was able to help me get through the emotional roller coaster that I experienced at every stage of selling my beautiful fountain grove home which survived the Tubbs fire. She even helped me deal with a very hostile neighbor situation which made everything more difficult and challenging. Romy is very wise and her advice was on target every time! Thirdly, Latoya handled everything so competently and professionally from getting very rep…

Eric is great at what he does and a true pro! He spent a lot of time with me finding the right place. After I found it he still stayed in touch afterward and answered questions on the phone, and still does to this day. He’s also good at being up-to-date on all the new changes happening In the market and the economy. Not too many is like Eric!

Mia is an amazing advocate and representative. She is always professional, timely, and knowledgeable. It was obvious to us as we worked through the process of looking at homes and dealing with other agents that Mia is very well respected within the industry. Mia's attention to detail is amazing. We had some challenges through the process but at each one, Mia was able to advise and guide us through whatever issue came up. We have both friends and family that have used Mia as well and have experienced the same level of outstanding representation. Although we hope to have found our forever home if we ever did need a Realtor®️ there would not be a question that Mia would represent us again.
